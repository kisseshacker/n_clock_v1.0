# N-Clock v1.0

![N-Clock](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kisseshacker/n_clock_v1.0/main/image.jpg)

This is an old-school project since 2012-2013. I thought it is lost forever, but fortunately Phi Quoc (luongquocphi1989@gmail.com) has a copy and shared to me. Thousand of thumbs-up to you.

Re-upload to Github for a better backup.

+ Schematic can be viewed by Cadence Orcad (original designed with version 9.2)
+ IDE: Code Composer Studio (by TI.com, with many many pre-configuration, which I have no idea now. Good luck!)
